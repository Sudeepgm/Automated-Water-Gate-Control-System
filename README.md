# Dam Gate Automation System
# Overview
This project uses NodeMCU to automate the opening and closing of dam gates based on water levels. It also sends email notifications about the status of each gate.
# Features

Automatic gate control using NodeMCU
Water level sensing and monitoring
Email notifications for gate status changes
Configurable thresholds for gate operations

# Hardware Requirements

NodeMCU board
Water level sensors
Servo motors or actuators for gate control
Power supply
LCD Display

# Software Requirements

Arduino IDE
Required libraries:

ESP8266WiFi
ESP8266WebServer
[List any other libraries used]



# Installation

Clone the repository:
Copygit clone https://github.com/yourusername/dam-gate-automation.git

Open the project in Arduino IDE.
Install required libraries through the Arduino Library Manager.
Configure the config.h file with your WiFi and email settings.

# Setup

Connect the NodeMCU to your computer.
Select the appropriate board and port in Arduino IDE.
Upload the sketch to your NodeMCU.

# Usage

Power on the NodeMCU.
The system will automatically start monitoring water levels and controlling gates.
Check your email for gate status notifications.

# Configuration
Edit config.h to customize:

WiFi credentials,
Email settings,
Water level thresholds,
Number of gates,
Pin assignments
